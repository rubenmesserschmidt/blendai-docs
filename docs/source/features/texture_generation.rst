Texture Generation
******************

Generate textures from your imagination in seconds. This feature is prefect for creating textures that are not in the main focus of your project or when you need a quick solution or inspiration.


Settings
========

Description
    The description of the texture you want to create. The more detailed you are, the better the texture will be. Here are some examples:

    - Red brick wall
    - Spring meadows with flowers
    - Blue glowing crystals
    - Transparent glass with cracks


Limitations
===========

BlendAI's texture generation feature creates great textures fast, but it has its limitations:

- **BlendAI can make mistakes**: The generated textures are not guaranteed to be perfect and can contain mistakes.
- **Description understanding**: BlendAI can miss details of your description which can lead to textures that are not what you expected.
- **Seams**: The generated textures are not guaranteed to be seamless and can contain visible seams here and there.


Pricing
=======

:Price per Texture: ``5`` Credits
