Test Script
***********

Automate recurring tasks to streamline your workflow by creating scripts with BlendAI.


Settings
========

Description
    Instructions of what the script should do. The more detailed the description, the better the script can be generated.

Space
    The space in which the script should be working in. For example, if you want to automate a task for shaders, choose the Node Editor.

Generation Quality
    See :ref:`here<preferences_generation_quality>`.


Limitations
===========

BlendAI's generate script feature can help you automate tasks but has some limitations:

- **BlendAI can make mistakes**: The generated scripts may contain errors and not works as expected. So use them with caution and test them before with :doc:`test_script`.
- **Random named objects**: Objects without a descriptive name may not be organized correctly. Meaning this feature only works well if your objects are named properly. This could be improved in the future.
