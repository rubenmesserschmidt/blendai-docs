******************
Save Script Preset
******************

Turn your scripts into your very own features and use them just like they were built-in.


How it Works
============

The current open script in the text editor will be saved as a preset. You can then run the script from the script preset list in the :ref:`Script Presets<main_panel_menu_script_presets>` or the context menu of the specified space.


Settings
========

Name
    The name of the script preset.

Space
    The space in which you want to use the script preset. There it will show up in the context menu.

Icon (optional)
    The icon of the script preset.

.. note::

    You can always change these settings later :ref:`here<main_panel_menu_script_presets>`.
    There you can also delete the script preset or show/hide it in the context menu of its space.
