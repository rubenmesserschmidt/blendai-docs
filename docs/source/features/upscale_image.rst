Upscale Image
*************

Upscale your images to a higher resolution in a matter of seconds. This feature is perfect for reducing render times and increasing the resolution of textures or other images.


How it Works
============

BlendAI will upscale the current open image in the image editor to the resolution you specified. The result will automatically be loaded into the image editor.


Settings
========

Resolution
    The resolution you want to upscale your image to. The original images aspect ratio will be kept automatically. Only higher resolutions are supported.

Face Enhance
    Enhance faces in the image to make them look more detailed and realistic. This option has no effect on images without faces.


Model
=====

BlendAI's Upscale Image feature is powered by NightmareAI. The processing happens on servers from Replicate.

Limitations
===========

BlendAI's upscale feature will save you endless hours, but it has its limitations:

- **Artifacts**: The upscaled image can contain artifacts or other mistakes that are not in the original image.
- **Blurry**: In low resolution images, very noisy areas can become blurry when upscaling.
