Input Field
===========



Popup
=====

Chat with BlendAI in a popup window with this :ref:`hotkey <preferences_keymap>`.
This allows you to get help as fast as possible, without interrupting your workflow.

While your answer is being generated, you can cancel anytime by pressing ``ESC``.

.. note::

    During the generation of an answer, the popup is attached to your cursor and moves with it. This is because it has to be redrawn every frame to show the progress of the generation. Hopefully, Blenders popup system will be improved in the future to allow for a more stable experience.

Create New Chat
    This will create a new empty chat. If you have an active chat, it will be saved to your chat history located in the :ref:`main_panel`.
