Render Suggestions
******************

Let BlendAI give you suggestions on how to improve your render. This feature is especially useful for beginners or when you are not sure how to make your results look more professional.

How it Works
============

BlendAI will give you suggestions on how to improve the current open image in the image editor. It will answer in the chat of the :doc:`../main_panel` with 5-10 suggestions and creative ideas.

.. tip::

    You can follow up with questions on specific suggestions or ask for how to implement them by replying to the :ref:`response<chat_conversation>` as usual.


Settings
========

Description (optional)
    A description of what your render should look like or specify what you want to improve. Leave this blank for general suggestions. Here are some examples:

    - Stylized rocks, how can I improve the lighting.
    - Realistic axe, I need help with the composition.
    - What can I do to make the scene more interesting?
    - How can I make the colors pop more?


Limitations
===========

BlendAI's render suggestions feature will make you improve, but it has its limitations:

- **BlendAI can make mistakes**: Just like when chatting, BlendAI can make mistakes when giving suggestions. Consider checking important information.
- **Image recognition**: BlendAI can miss details in the image which can lead to suggestions that are wrong or already implemented.
