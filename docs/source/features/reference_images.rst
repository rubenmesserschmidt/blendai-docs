Reference Images
****************

Generate reference images for your projects. This allows you to visualize your ideas and get plenty of inspiration, especially when creating something that does not exist yet.

How it Works
============

BlendAI will give you suggestions on how to improve the current open image in the image editor. It will answer in the chat of the :doc:`main_panel` with 5-10 suggestions and creative ideas.

.. tip::

    You can follow up with questions on specific suggestions or ask for how to implement them by replying to the :ref:`response<chat_conversation>` as usual.


Settings
========

Description (optional)
    A description of what your render should look like or specify what you want to improve. Leave this blank for general suggestions.


Limitations
===========

BlendAI's render suggestions feature will make you improve, but it has its limitations:

- **BlendAI can make mistakes**: Just like when chatting, BlendAI can make mistakes when giving suggestions. Consider checking important information.
- **Image recognition**: BlendAI can miss details in the image which can lead to suggestions that are wrong or already implemented.
