Reference Images
****************

Generate reference images for your projects. This allows you to visualize your ideas and get plenty of inspiration, especially when creating something that does not exist yet.


Settings
========

Description
    The description of the object or scene you want to create. The more detailed you are, the better the reference images will be. Here are some examples:

    - Futuristic car
    - Alien plant
    - Holographic ring
    - New planet

Amount
    :Single: Generate an image with a single visualization of your idea. Great for anything you have in mind.
    :Multiple: Generate an image with multiple variations of your idea. This can be useful to explore different possibilities in one go. Works best with objects, whole scenes are not recommended.


Limitations
===========

BlendAI's reference images feature will inspire you, but it has its limitations:

- **BlendAI can make mistakes**: The generated images are not guaranteed to be perfect and can contain mistakes.
- **Description understanding**: BlendAI can miss details of your description which can lead to images that are not what you expected.
- **Multiple variations**: When using the multiple option, sometimes variations can be very similar to each other or there can be only one at all.


Pricing
=======

:Price per Reference Image: ``10`` Credits
