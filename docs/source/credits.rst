Credits
*******

Credits are the virtual currency of BlendAI. For performing a feature, you have to pay a small amount of credits. This system is necessary because AI needs huge calculations which are processed on external high-performance servers and have to be paid according to their complexity. So basically, credits ensure that these costs get covered.

.. important::

    If a generation should fail due to an internal server error, you will get your credits back.
    In any other case, credits are non-refundable.
