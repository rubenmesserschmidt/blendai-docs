Transform
=========

You can move, rotate, and scale a section box like any other object in Blender.

###############
Plane Transform
###############

You can move individual planes of the box by clicking and dragging the black handles located in the center of each one.
Or transform them by a specified amount with the :ref:`Plane Transform <settings:Transform>` setting.

**Commit**
    Commit the changes with ``LEFT CLICK``.

**Cancel**
    Press ``RIGHT CLICK`` or ``ESC`` while moving, to reset the plane to its last location.


##############
Edge Transform
##############

You can move the edges of each plane additionally to create a huge variety of shapes.
Or transform them by a specified amount with the :ref:`Edge Transform <settings:Transform>` setting.

Therefor click the plane which edges you want to move once, then hold ``E`` to enable handles located on each edge. You can change this hotkey in the :ref:`Preferences <preferences:keymap>`

These handles behave just like when transforming a plane, but shifting only the edge.
