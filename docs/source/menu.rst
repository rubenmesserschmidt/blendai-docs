Settings
********

Each outliner entry represents one section box, giving you access to the following settings:

**Select**
    By clicking on a listed section box it gets selected and automatically selected in the viewport as well.
    The same goes the other way around, when selecting a section box in the viewport it will be selected automatically in the hierarchy.

**Rename**
    By double clicking on a listed section box you can giving it any name you want.

**Enable**
    When ticked, the section box is enabled, else the section box gets disabled which is like it doesn't exist.

**Hide**
    When ticked, the bounding box of the section box is hidden. This won't affect the visibility of the sections made from the box.

**Hide Render**
    When ticked, the section box is disabled in renders.

**Reload (Collection Section Boxes only)**
    When changing the content of the collection of a Collection Section Box use this feature to include/exclude the added/removed objects from the section box.

Operations
**********

On the right side of the outliner you can perform the following operations:

**Create**
    :ref:`manage:create` a new section box. This works the same as the create option in the *Object Context Menu*.

**Delete**
    :ref:`manage:delete` the active section box.

**Move**
    Move entries up or down in the list.

**Apply**
    Apply the active section box to their objects. This will also delete the section box.

**Apply as Copy**
    Apply the active section box and their objects as a copy of themselves. This will keep the section box and their objects unchanged.
